            Hello! I’m Arman, a web developer, passionate
            about creating clean code on user-friendly designs. I enjoy working
            with front-end tools like Tailwind CSS, React, and Figma.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond coding, I prioritize a Muslim lifestyle, incorporating core
            values like prayer, reading, meaningful relationships, and
            mindfulness. I’m always eager to connect on halal projects,
            especially those that aim to uplift the community—feel free to reach
            out!
